# ✅ Qdrant Vector Search Error - RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
The `/api/assistant/query` endpoint was failing with error:
```
{"detail":"Vector search against Qdrant failed."}
```

## Root Cause
**Wrong Qdrant collection name in `.env` file:**
- ❌ **Configured:** `QDRANT_COLLECTION=central_act_2909_v3` (doesn't exist)
- ✅ **Actual:** `QDRANT_COLLECTION=central_acts_v2` (exists with 314,525 vectors)

## Solution Applied
Fixed `e:\Project\Website- AI law\v7\fastapi\.env`:

```bash
# Before (❌ WRONG)
QDRANT_URL=http://3.95.219.204:6333/
QDRANT_COLLECTION=central_act_2909_v3

# After (✅ CORRECT)
QDRANT_URL=http://3.95.219.204:6333
QDRANT_COLLECTION=central_acts_v2
```

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Network connection to Qdrant server confirmed
2. ✅ Collection `central_acts_v2` verified (314,525 vectors)
3. ✅ Server restarted and loads Qdrant successfully
4. ✅ API endpoint tested and working

## Test Results
**Successful API call:**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/assistant/query" `
  -Method POST `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{"query":"What is Section 185 Companies Act 2013?"}'
```

**Response:** HTTP 200 OK with full JSON response including:
- Query expansions
- Vector search results  
- Sources from Companies Act 2013
- AI-generated answer

## Important Notes
- ⚠️ **Server must be restarted** after changing `.env` for changes to take effect
- ✅ Qdrant connection confirmed in logs: `HTTP Request: GET http://3.95.219.204:6333 "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"`
- ✅ Collection has good data coverage with 314K+ vectors
